### Version 1.2

Vesion 1.2 was the version that was after figuring out that the ESP32 platform was going to be used. This was need to be programed with an external uart chip though the header pins. The header pins are planed to be used for board to board communication and power transfer.

### Version 2.0

Version 2.0 was the first version with the ESP32-S3 as the microcontroler to be used. This was an improvment as it meant that there was no need for the usb to Uart bridge that was needed to program the chip.
